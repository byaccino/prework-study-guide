## Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this guide so that I can go back and reference it when I get stuck building a web application. I learned how to interact with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to push and pull changes into my github repository and mark issues once resolved in an effort to stay organized.

## Installation

## Usage

I can use this to understand how to build a web app and how to use my DevTools console to see JavaScript running.
